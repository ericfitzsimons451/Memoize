# Memoize

### A web-based teaching tool for Turing students.

## Installation Steps

```git clone https://github.com/ericfitzsimons451/Memoize.git```

```npm install```

```npm start```

## Background/About

### This project was my first attempt at a solo application using ReactJS.  As a 2nd module student at Turing School of Software and Design, this weeklong endeavor was part of our final evaluation.  Datasets were created to mock a portion of the necessary concepts that were covered in our six-week module.  Our app was designed to be a teaching tool that could be used to solidify concepts learned during the course of study.  The project required an API fetch from Heroku, the use of Sass styling and a teste suite using Jest/Enzyme.  

## Tech Stack

- ReactJS
- JSX
- Jest/Enzyme testing
- Sass
- Heroku API fetch

## Deployed Website

## Next Steps

### Future iterations:
- Add details to dataset so that answer card has more information.
- Add transitions, from Display All view to Single Card, for better UI.
- Add filter function to sort by categories.
- Implement login to save player information.
