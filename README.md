## Background/About

### This project was my first attempt at a solo application using ReactJS.  As a 2nd module student at Turing School of Software and Design, this week-long endeavor was part of our final evaluation.  Datasets were created to represent a portion of the necessary concepts that were covered in our six-week module.  My app was designed to be a teaching tool to solidify concepts learned during our course of study.  The project required an API fetch from Heroku, the use of Sass styling and a test suite using Jest/Enzyme.  

## Tech Stack

- ReactJS
- JSX
- Jest/Enzyme testing
- Sass
- Heroku API fetch

## Deployed Website

## Future iterations:
- Add details to dataset so that answer card has more information.
- Add transitions, from Display All view to Single Card, for better UI.
- Add filter function to sort by categories.
- Implement login to save player information.
